## About the Data

### Data Source

The data presented on this website is sourced from publicly available Australian energy rating databases, manufacturer specifications, and market research reports. Charts and product details are based on aggregated and anonymized data reflecting the most common television models and their energy performance.

### Data Processing

Raw data was collected, cleaned, and processed to ensure consistency and relevance. Data was grouped by screen technology, size, brand, and energy consumption. Visualizations were generated using standard charting tools and image editors to provide clear and accessible insights.

### Privacy

No personal or sensitive user data is collected, stored, or displayed by this website. All data used is either publicly available or anonymized, ensuring compliance with privacy standards.

### Accuracy and Limitations

While every effort has been made to ensure the accuracy of the information and visualizations, the data may not reflect the most recent market changes or all available products. Energy ratings and consumption figures are based on manufacturer disclosures and may vary in real-world usage. The charts are intended for general guidance and should not be used as the sole basis for purchasing decisions.

### Ethics

This project is committed to ethical data use. All data sources are credited where possible, and no proprietary or confidential information is used. The visualizations are designed to inform and educate consumers about energy efficiency without promoting specific brands or products unfairly.
